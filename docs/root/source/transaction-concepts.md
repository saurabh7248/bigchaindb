# Transaction Concepts

In BigchainDB, _Transactions_ are used to register, issue, create or transfer
things (e.g. assets).

Transactions are the most basic kind of record stored by BigchainDB. There are
two kinds: CREATE transactions and TRANSFER transactions.

## CREATE Transactions

A CREATE transaction can be used to register, issue, create or otherwise
initiate the history of a single thing (or asset) in BigchainDB. For example,
one might register an identity or a creative work. The things are often called
"assets" but they might not be literal assets.

BigchainDB supports divisible assets as of BigchainDB Server v0.8.0.
That means you can create/register an asset with an initial quantity,
e.g. 700 oak trees. Divisible assets can be split apart or recombined
by transfer transactions (described more below).

A CREATE transaction also establishes the conditions that must be met to
transfer the asset(s). For example, there may be a condition that any transfer
must be signed (cryptographically) by the private key associated with a
given public key. More sophisticated conditions are possible.
BigchainDB's conditions are based on the crypto-conditions of the [Interledger
Protocol (ILP)](https://interledger.org/).

## TRANSFER Transactions

A TRANSFER transaction can transfer an asset
by fulfilling the current conditions on the asset.
It must also specify new transfer conditions.

**Example 1:** Suppose a red car is owned and controlled by Joe.
Suppose the current transfer condition on the car says
that any valid transfer must be signed by Joe.
Joe and a buyer named Rae could build a TRANSFER transaction containing
Joe's signature (to fulfill the current transfer condition)
plus a new transfer condition saying that any valid transfer
must be signed by Rae.

**Example 2:** Someone might construct a TRANSFER transaction
that fulfills the transfer conditions on four
previously-untransferred assets of the same asset type
e.g. paperclips. The amounts might be 20, 10, 45 and 25, say,
for a total of 100 paperclips.
The TRANSFER transaction would also set up new transfer conditions.
For example, maybe a set of 60 paperclips can only be transferred
if Gertrude signs, and a separate set of 40 paperclips can only be
transferred if both Jack and Kelly sign.
Note how the sum of the incoming paperclips must equal the sum
of the outgoing paperclips (100).

## Transaction Validity

When a node is asked to check if a transaction is valid, it checks several
things. Some things it checks are:

* Are all the fulfillments valid? (Do they correctly satisfy the conditions
  they claim to satisfy?)
* If it's a creation transaction, is the asset valid?
* If it's a transfer transaction:
   * Is it trying to fulfill a condition in a nonexistent transaction?
   * Is it trying to fulfill a condition that's not in a valid transaction?
     (It's okay if the condition is in a transaction in an invalid block; those
     transactions are ignored. Transactions in the backlog or undecided blocks
     are not ignored.)
   * Is it trying to fulfill a condition that has already been fulfilled, or
     that some other pending transaction (in the backlog or an undecided block)
     also aims to fulfill?
   * Is the asset ID in the transaction the same as the asset ID in all
     transactions whose conditions are being fulfilled?
   * Is the sum of the amounts in the fulfillments equal
     to the sum of the amounts in the new conditions?

If you're curious about the details of transaction validation, the code is in
the `validate` method of the `Transaction` class, in `bigchaindb/models.py` (at
the time of writing).

Note: The check to see if the transaction ID is equal to the hash of the
transaction body is actually done whenever the transaction is converted from a
Python dict to a Transaction object, which must be done before the `validate`
method can be called (since it's called on a Transaction object).
